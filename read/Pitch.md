# Pitches
​
## Playlist Thing X
​
- Scrape data from rateyourmusic.com (or use some music db api) and use that data to make a playlist with the spotify api
- As a user of RYM, I want to quickly make playlist from music charts.
- Display data from RYM and make a spotify playlist
​
## Restaurant Creeper
​
- use instagram to map restaurants posted by users
- a chef I follow on instrgram posts restaurants all the time, too often for me to keep track of. I still want to eventually go to some of these restaurants but not scroll through their profile everytime.
- map of one users restaurant shout outs.
​
## Vacation Planner
​
- Extend city explorer. Add info about local events and help find cheap tickets.
- I want to visit [location] but am unsure what's going on there. Also when is it cheap/reasonable to fly in? What's the weather usually like at that time of year?
- city explorer with event and flight finder
​
## Pokemon Something
​
- An app to help you create teams of pokemon. And maybe a battle tester...
- There are so many pokemans, too many to keep track of and I don't even have them all. If only there was an app to see all pokemon and their stats/moves and organize them into theoretical teams to work towards.
- Get pokemon data and organize it into teams of at most 6.
